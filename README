zms3.formulator
===============

This Python Package is an Extension for the ZMS3 Publishing System <http://www.zms-publishing.com> (Open Source Content Management for Science, Technology and Medicine) to integrate the `JSON Editor by Jeremy Dorn <http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor>`_, Redwood City, CA.

A JSON Schema is generated based on special content objects and used to transform it into an HTML Form handling all the front-end validations.

The data submitted by the generated HTML Form can be transmitted into a remote SQL Storage <http://www.sqlalchemy.org> for further processing and evaluation using standard reporting tools - or data will be stored into the included `ZODB <http://www.zodb.org>`_ and/or sent by mail.

Form submission provides support for the reCAPTCHA service by Google <https://www.google.com/recaptcha> to protect from spam and abuse.
