zms3.formulator
===============

This Python Package is an Extension for the `ZMS3 Publishing System <http://www.zms-publishing.com>`_ (Open Source Content Management for Science, Technology and Medicine) to integrate the `JSON Editor by Jeremy Dorn <http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor>`_, Redwood City, CA.

A JSON Schema is generated based on special content objects and used to transform it into an HTML Form.

The data of the JSON Output submitted by the generated HTML Form is transmitted into a `SQL Storage <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_.

Form submission provides support for the `reCAPTCHA service by Google <https://www.google.com/recaptcha>`_ to protect from spam and abuse.
